The Subtraction Game
====================

Beginning with a pile of 21 stones, players alternate removing stones until none are left. On her turn, a player may take 1, 2, or 3 stones. The player who takes the last stone is the winner.

A version of this game was played on an episode of Survivor, where they called it Thai 21.

0. Play a few games with your partner by hand.

1. Get the file `subtraction.py` from the `Examples` diretory. Copy it to your repl.it workspace so you can run it.

2. Play a few rounds against the computer with a low depth limit, like 2. Can you win?

3. Now increase the depth limit to 5 and then to 10. How does the computer’s play change?

4. What’s the winning strategy for this subtraction game?

5. Now increase the depth limit to 20. What happens?

6. Modify the program to use a pile of 100 stones and allow the players to take any number from 1 to 10. How does the winning strategy change?

7. What if you have *n* stones and can take any number from 1 to *k*? What is the optimal strategy in that case?

8. Think about the charateristics of this game. What are some other games that would be a good fit for this version of the minimax algorithm? Think of some games where this version of minimax would not be successful.
