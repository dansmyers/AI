*The Initiation Well of the Quinta de Regaleira palace in Sinta, Portugal. The palace and its surrounding estate were constructed in the early 1900s by the wealthy and eccentric Portuguese businessman Carvalho Monteiro, who filled the property with Romantic architecture and symbolism related to Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, and esoteric philosophy. The "well" is one of two on the property and is constructed like an inverted tower, descending nine levels deep. The floor at the bottom is inlaid with a Templar cross.*
