# Six Degrees of Wikipedia (feat. Claude Code)

## Overview

It's a bit old-fashioned at this point, but you might have heard of the [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon): the idea that any actor can be linked to Kevin Bacon through shared film roles. The general concept is the **six degrees of separation**, which theorizes that almost everyone on Earth is separated by at most six personal connections. Similar ideas exist in other fields:

- The [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) measures the distance of a researcher from the prolific 20th Century Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős, who was known for having a huge number of collaborators. Erdős himself has a number of 0. Anyone who co-authored a paper with Erdős has a number of 1, their co-authors have number of 2, and so forth. Mine is 5.

- The Sabbath number connects musicians to the members of Black Sabbath, which had a huge number of lineup changes during the 70s and 80s. Members of Black Sabbath have a number of 0. Anyone who collaborated with a member on a recording or performance has a number of 1, and so forth.

- For the true Rennaisance man or woman, there's the [Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath number](https://news.asu.edu/20160126-creativity-lawrence-krauss-erdos-bacon-sabbath-score), which adds the three scores. Physicist Stephen Hawking and futurist Ray Kurzweil both have an 8 (Hawking appeared as a guest voice overdub on a Pink Floyd album and Kurzweil appeared at a concert with Tori Amos). Brian May, guitarist of Queen, has a 9.

A more recent version of the game is the Six Degrees of Wikipedia: connect one article to another by following a chain of links. This leads directly to the [Wikipedia speedrun](https://wikispeedruns.com/) where the goal is to connect articles as fast as possible.

In this project you're going to write a web app that can solve Wikipedia connections. This will let us practice using state-based search on a bigger application. Along the way, you'll get to practice:

- Making a basic web application with a front-end, back-end, and API
- Making API calls to retrieve Wikipedia pages
- Using *bidirectional iterative deepening* to make the search more efficient

## Claude Code

The other major part of this project is using **Claude Code**, an AI programming tool made by Anthropic. Claude Code is an *agentic AI*, meaning that it runs in a loop, can use tools, make plans, and evaluate its own progress. As we'll see, it has the ability to take a general spec for a program and convert it to code in a frankly mind-blowing way.

***Agentic software development is the future of programming***.
