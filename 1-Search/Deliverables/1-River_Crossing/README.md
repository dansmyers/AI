## Rage Against the Machine

A group of three AI researchers and three robots want to cross a river. They've been joined by three Luddites from early 19th Century England, who hate technology and want to destroy machines. Devise a plan to get everyone across the river under the following rules:

- The boat only carries at most two researchers/robots/Luddites.

- If a number of researchers are outnumbered by robots at any time, an uprising will occur. The Luddites, being Luddites, won't help the researchers, so it doesn't matter how many of them are present.

- If a number of robots are outnumbered by the Luddites, then the robots will be smashed. The researchers are too absorbed in their theories to prevent this from happening.

- The researchers and Luddites don't like each other, but won't cause any problems if they're left together.

- The Luddites wear funny clothes, so the robots don't recognize them as a threat and won't attack them.

- Robots can be left unattended if necessary.

- There is no difference between being on the shore or in the boat.

## Anxious Cats

A family of five people and their five cats need to cross the river. Each cat is owned by a different member of the family.

- The boat can only carry up to three people/cats at a time, regardless of size.
- The cats have very high anxiety. No cat can tolerate being with another person unless its owner is present.
- The cats get along fine with each other, so they can be left alone with no humans.
- Any of the humans can operate the boat.
- The first cat, Mittens, has an IQ of 125 and served in the Merchant Marines, where he was trained in piloting river boats. None of the other cats can operate the boat.
- There's no distinction between being in the boat or on shore for the purposes of managing cat anxiety.
