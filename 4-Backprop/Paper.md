## Create the rough draft

It’s now time to turn the detailed outline you produced in Phase 3 into a full draft of the paper.

You have broad freedom to complete this phase in the way that you feel is best, including developing your own AI prompts.

I do, however, have one important guideline: don’t try to create your draft by running one single prompt, and then repeatedly editing that prompt. A much better strategy is to start by generating a rough draft, then collaboratively edit it by asking the AI questions and telling it to make specific changes to parts that need to be improved.

Once you generate your initial draft, enter it in your log. As you make revisions, record your thought process and any prompts that you use into the log, so you have a record of your AI interactions (and manual edits) that led up to the final draft.

You’ll need to include a list of references at the end. I recommend using APA-style citations with the (Name, Year) form.

Here are some other tips:

- You could, of course, start by asking the AI to take your detailed outline and expand it into full sentences. Consider carefully if that’s the best way to begin. You might do better by drafting the introduction and conclusion first to give the AI more context.

- You will need to include references to your cited works and relevant factual information. Remember that AI tools often struggle with this. Carefully check all factual information in your draft. You will probably need to make hand edits to make sure the information you include is correct.

- Maintain your agency! Remember that you are in charge and the AI is there to execute your vision. Don’t outsource your thinking!


## Workshop

Once you have completed your draft, ask the AI to take on the role of a peer reviewer and provide feedback:

*Please take on the role of a peer reviewer for the first draft of my research paper on [topic]. Read through my draft and provide constructive feedback as if you were a classmate. Specifically, please comment on:*
- *The clarity and strength of my thesis statement in the introduction*
- *How well my evidence and sources support the claims in each paragraph*
- *The logic and flow of the overall structure and arguments*
- *Any sections that need better transitions or more explanation*
- *The quality of my conclusion in summarizing the main points*
- *Any grammar/spelling/style issues you noticed*

*Please provide at least 5 specific and actionable suggestions for improving my draft, including identifying any areas that need to be expanded, reorganized, or reworked.*

Enter the AI response into your log and then write a few sentences giving your evaluation of its feedback. Does the AI make good points? Record the changes, if any, that you make in response.


## Submission

Submit your final revised draft and logbook and the deliverable for this phase. Remember that your log should record the AI interactions and your reflective responses that led to the creation of the final draft.
