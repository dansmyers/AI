## Find relevant sources

Use academic search engines and databases to find four relevant scholarly sources on your topic, following the research plan developed in Phase 1.

Tip: you can use Bing AI as a starting point (recall that Bing is connected to the Internet, so it can perform real searches). Here’s an example prompt:

*Please research academic articles giving an overview of scholarship on [insert topic] and recommend three to five accessible papers that I can use to begin researching it in more detail.*

Remember that Bing may return a mixture of references to real papers and made-up results. Carefully evaluate its output. Even if it returns a made-up paper, it may give you ideas for directions that you can explore through a more reliable academic search engine.

In your logbook, summarize the search process. Explain why you chose the papers that you did. Reflect on the quality of the results you obtained.

At the end of this process, you should have 4-5 promising sources relevant to your topic.

## Summarize your sources

Carefully read your articles. This will take some time. For each one—by yourself, without an AI tool—write a list of the key points it makes related to your topic. What arguments does it make or what factual evidence does it supply? How does its content relate to your topic?

Tip: Because you have already done the work of refining your topic and creating a research plan, you should have a general sense of what kinds of information are useful for your paper.

Once you have prepared your bulleted summaries, use an AI model to convert your summaries into paragraphs. If your articles are in PDF files, you can upload them to Claude and then ask it to produce a summary of the article following your bullet points.

Paste each summary into your log, then write reflections on the accuracy and quality of the AI summaries. Make any necessary edits directly in the logbook.

## Synthesizing sources

Now use the following prompt to synthesize the main points from all of your sources:

*I am researching [topic] and have summarized several academic sources as part of my annotated bibliography. The key points from my summaries are:*

- *[Bullet point summary of key points from Source 1]*
- *[Bullet point summary of key points from Source 2]*
- *[Bullet point summary of key points from Sources 3-5]*

*Please synthesize these main points from my source summaries into a coherent 1-2 paragraph overview. Identify common themes and relationships between the sources. What collective conclusions can be drawn about my research topic from these sources?*

Again, put the results in your logbook and write a response. What does this synthesis suggest about the direction of your paper? What ideas about your topic seem more relevant and interesting?


## Prepare the bibliography

Compile citations for each source in APA format, the revised summaries, and synthesis paragraphs from your logbook into an annotated bibliography document.

Submit the annotated bibliography and logbook showing your process and reflections as the Phase 2 deliverables.
