## Brainstorming

Prompt the AI conversationally to discuss potential thesis ideas related to your research topic. For example:

*I have been researching [topic]. Based on what I've learned, here are some ideas I'm considering for my thesis statement: [summarize main findings and interests here]. What are your thoughts on these concepts? What would make a compelling and defensible thesis based on this research?*


Have a back-and-forth discussion prompting the AI to help refine and focus your main claims and ideas. Record the full conversation in your logbook.


## Drafting a thesis statement

Based on your topic exploration so far, draft 1-2 potential thesis statements that present an insightful, defensible central claim. Aim for precision and significance.

In your logbook, reflect on what makes an effective thesis statement.

Prompt the AI: *Please provide feedback on my draft thesis statements for my paper on [topic]. Suggest ways to improve clarity, focus, and compellingness*.

Refine your thesis based on the AI feedback. Record iterations in your logbook.

## Structural outline

Create a rough outline with the major sections of your paper—introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion—and short summaries of the key points and evidence to be covered in each section.

Prompt the AI: *Please review the structure of my outline and provide feedback. Are there any missing elements or logical gaps?*

Refine the structural outline based on the AI feedback. As before, enter the starting outline, the AI’s output, and your reflective revisions into your logbook.


## Detailed outline

You’re now going to create a detailed outline that bridges the gap between your high-level structural outline and the actual draft you’ll write in the next phase. Use the following prompt:

*I have created a structural outline for my research paper:*

*[Outline]*

*Please take this structural outline and expand it into a detailed paragraph-level outline. Indicate places in the detailed outline that should be supported by relevant evidence, quotes, or citations.*

Record the detailed outline in your logbook.


## Submission

Submit a document containing your thesis statement and detailed outline as the deliverable for this phase.
