## Overview

Charles Darwin published *On the Origin of Species* in 1859. One of the most important books in scientific history, it proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection as the dominant explanation for the diversity of life and a unifying concept underlying all of biology. Some concepts of evolutionary theory existed in natural science before Darwin's time, but they were mostly speculative and the mechanism of change was not well-understood. Darwin explained how natural selection of heritable traits leads to gradual, continuous change within populations, and marshalled an overwhelming amount of evidence for his theory based upon twenty years of research. *On the Origin of Species* also supported the then-radical concept of the branching descent of all species from a common ancestor - the Tree of Life.
