## Overview

**Under construction**. The content here is likely to change. Don't work on anything yet.

## Topics

- Objective functions
- Local vs. global minima and maxima
- Hill-climbing search
- Simulated annealing
- Genetic algorithm concepts: populations, fitness, crossover, mutation
- Particle swarm optimization

- Recursively formulating dynamic programming problems
- The bottom-up solution strategy for DP problems
- Example problems: 0/1 knapsack, rod cutting, edit distance, longest increasing subsequence
- Determining the complexity of a bottom-up DP algorithm

 
## Resources

Dynamic programming:

- Start with this article I wrote that gives an overview of the concept and looks at two canonical problems: 0/1 knapsack and rod cutting.
- Then read this article on the Levenshtein edit distance.
- Here's a third article on longest increasing subsequence. Focus on the first part, which describes the *O*(*n*<sup>2</sup>) solution. The second part describes an *O*(*n* log *n*) solution that is interesting, but wonky; it's optional if you're interested, but not required.
