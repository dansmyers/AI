This course is about the development of computation, mathematics, and technology in the ancient world.

In this, our major research project, you’re going to choose one particular aspect of AI and write about why it’s important. This could be a new technology, a tool, a theorem, a computational method, or something else related to the broad themes of the course; I’ll give you some suggestions for choosing a topic below.

We’re also using this assignment to practice researching and writing with AI tools. Each phase integrates AI and you will be able to practice using AI in all phases of the writing process.

Note that, while I expect you to use AI to complete this assignment, some parts must still be done by you, yourself, without AI assistance. Review the AI statement on the course syllabus.


## Goals

The overall goal of this assignment is for you to practice using AI in a moderate-length research-based essay. In addition to developing a deeper understanding of your research topic, you will also:

- **Understand the strengths and weaknesses of AI**. Language models are powerful, but aren’t good at everything. You should have a nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of AI and know how to choose the right tool for a particular task, which includes choosing between different AI tools (for example, Copilot vs. Claude) and knowing when a search engine is a better choice than an AI.


- **Understand how to use AI in the writing process**, beyond simply giving it a prompt that generates a complete essay. We’ll practice using AI to generate ideas, refine a thesis statement, formulate a research plan, and collaboratively edit your work.


- **Maintain agency** and critically evaluate AI output for both correctness and quality. Remember that you are always in control and you’re free to accept, reject, or modify any output the AI gives you. Use AI to refine the expression of your own vision, not to outsource your own thinking.


- **Reflect on your experiences**. AI is new for all of us, so you need to think carefully about what you’ve learned and how to integrate it into your future work.


## Choosing a Topic

Identify some historical innovation related to computation, math, technology, or a related area and write about why it was significant at the time of its creation and why it still matters to the modern world.

This is intentionally broad. I want you to explore your own interests and bring in ideas from your other classes. Here are some flexible guidelines to think about when choosing your topic:

- Focus on a **specific innovation**. For example, ideas like “agriculture” or “clocks” are too broad—you’d have to write a survey of thousands of years of history—but you could focus on one particular innovation within those areas, such as the marine chronometer or the singing plow.

- You don’t have to choose a physical thing. You can write about a mathematical result, or a theory, book, or intellectual movement.

- Choose a topic that’s preferably pre-1800. It’s okay to bring in connections from the modern world when they're appropriate, but we'd prefer to focus on older historical innovations, not just the development of well-known industrial-era technologies.

This assignment is broken up into five phases, described in detail below. Each phase has a particular deliverable that you’ll submit. Read each phase carefully, because I will give you specific steps and prompts to use with AI tools for each part.

You will also maintain a **logbook** keeping track of each step in your process. This is where you’ll record the prompts you give to the AI, the output it produces, and your responses and revisions. The directions for each phase will tell you when to record something in the log; make sure to read them carefully.

The log serves two purposes:

- It’s the record of your work-in-progress, so you don’t have to worry about losing anything if you accidentally delete an AI conversation.

- It demonstrates your thinking and reflection. Remember: your goal is to use AI as a tool to execute your own vision.


## General AI Tips

- Carefully craft your inputs—generic prompts get generic results. Ask focused questions.

- AI models can easily hallucinate information, including facts, references, and dates. Don’t trust the output of a model unless you know it’s true or can verify it with a reliable third-party source. AI works best on topics you know well. You still need to do independent research!

- Balance AI assistance with doing your own analysis and using your own voice. Maintain agency over your work!

- Use the right tool for each task. I recommend using either Copilot or Claude as your main model: both are better than the free version of ChatGPT at this point. Remember that Copilot can access the Internet, but sometimes a conventional search engine is a better choice.

- Remember that AI has limitations and biases. Do not assume AI output is factual or neutral. Validate against credible sources.

- Consider the ethical implications of relying on AI for various tasks. Reflect on when human effort is still essential.


## Phase 1: Topic Generation and Research Planning

### Generating topic ideas

To begin, you will use an AI tool to help generate some initial topic ideas that you can choose from for your research paper. The goal here is to get your creative juices flowing—the AI will suggest a wide range of possibilities to consider.

Open your logbook document. Write the following prompt:

*Please generate 10 potential topics for my research paper in the course 'Ancient Algorithms'. The topics should relate to innovations in ancient technology, mathematics, or computation from before 1800 CE. The subject of the paper should be a specific tool, invention, theory, written work, or intellectual movement. Present each topic idea as a title*.

Input the prompt into an AI tool, either Claude or Copilot in Creative mode. Copy the generated list of 10 topic ideas into your logbook.

Write a few sentences reflecting on the topic ideas. Do they seem interesting? Are they appropriate for the scope of this assignment? Would you revise or modify any of them? Note your thoughts in your logbook.

Tip: If you need to, prompt the AI to generate more ideas. Try refining the prompt to make it more restrictive; for example, prompting it to consider only tools related to astronomy.

Based on the AI generated ideas and your own interests, choose 2-3 topic ideas to explore further. Write a few sentences explaining why you chose them.

### Background pre-research

Next, use the Copilot AI in Creative mode to gather some information on your potential topics. Think of this as “pre-research” to give you high-level background on the topics so you can further evaluate them. Here’s an example prompt:

*I’d like to learn more about [insert topic]. Please provide an overview of its historical background and significance. Include information on what it is, when and where it was created, why it was an important innovation in its time period, and its relevance to modern society*.

Repeat the query for each of your potential topics. Review the background summary (keeping in mind that it might contain errors), then write your own assessment of the topic and its suitability for your paper. 

After evaluating each topic, select the one that you feel is most interesting and write a few sentences about why you chose it.


### Research planning

Now, let’s use the AI to refine your idea and get some reflective feedback. Use the following prompt:

*One topic idea I want to develop is [insert topic]. Please provide feedback to refine this topic for a 5-7 page research paper. Clarify the scope, reduce ambiguity, and suggest 3-5 kinds of evidence I should look for to properly investigate this topic*.

Review the AI output and use it to refine your topic idea. Record the original prompt, AI response, and your reflections on the AI’s feedback in your logbook. Write down your revised topic idea.

Using your refined topic, prompt the AI to outline specific steps for finding sources and evidence to research your chosen innovation. Develop your own prompt for this step and record it in your logbook.

Record the AI suggested research plan in your logbook. Make any revisions to the plan you think would improve it. If you think the plan isn’t clear, revise your prompt and try again until you get a more useful response.


### Submission

At the end of this phase, you’ll submit the following to an assignment I'll create on Canvas:

- Your topic.
- Your research plan.
- The logbook detailing your conversations with the AI and reflections on its responses.
