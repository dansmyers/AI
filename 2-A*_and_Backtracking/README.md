# Sprint 2: A*, Constraint Satisfaction, and Backtracking

## Overview

## Topics

- Heuristic functions
- Greedy best-first search
- A* search
- Admissible heuristics
- Proof of the optimality of A*
- Constraint satisfaction problems
- Backtracking for CSPs
- Constraint propgation
- Boolean satisfiability and 3-CNF-SAT

## Deliverables

Complete the three projects in the `Deliverables` directory. Use Claude Code to help you with each one. One of the keys of this unit is to practice *developing incrementally*. Pay attention to the advice on building the projects in steps and testing as you go!

If you haven't done so, move your Sprint 1 project into its own directory. Create new directory to hold the specs, code, etc. for each project in this unit; don't try to keep everything in one big directory with no organization.

- Start with the notes in the `Notes` directory
