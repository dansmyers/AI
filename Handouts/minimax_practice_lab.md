The Subtraction Game
====================

Beginning with a pile of 21 stones, players alternate removing stones until none are left. On her turn, a player may take 1, 2, or 3 stones. The player who takes the last stone is the winner.

A version of this game was played on an episode of Survivor, where they called it Thai 21.

0. Play a few games with your partner by hand.

1. Get the file `subtraction.py` from the `Examples` diretory. Copy it to your repl.it workspace so you can run it.

2. Play a few rounds against the computer with a low depth limit, like 2. Can you win?

3. Now increase the depth limit to 5 and then to 10. How does the computer’s play change?

4. What’s the winning strategy for this subtraction game?

5. Now increase the depth limit to 20. What happens?

6. Think about and list some other games that would be a good fit for the minimax strategy. What characteristics are we assuming the game has?
