## Official Course Description

**CMS 430 Artificial Intelligence**: Selective survey of key concepts and applications of artificial intelligence, as well as common programming frameworks and libraries for solving AI problems. Possible subtopics include knowledge representation, state spaces/searching, heuristic search, vision, natural language processing, and an introduction to machine learning techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Explain key concepts in the field of artificial intelligence.

2. Use state-based searching techniques, including breadth-first, depth-first, and A* search, to find solutions to constrained planning problems.

3. Apply the minimax algorithm to two-player game AIs.

4. Use machine learning models solve classification problems. Implement machine learning programs using a suitable programming framework.

5. Describe neural network models for machine learning. Discuss techniques used in modern deep learning.

6. Critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current-generation AI models, including large language models like ChatGPT.

## Required AI tools

 Practicing programming using AI tools is a core element of this class. You are *required* to subscribe to a $20 per month plan for [Anthropic's Claude](https://claude.ai/), which we'll use throughout the course.

 - *I already subscribe to a different model, can I use that one instead?* No, you are required to use Claude for this course.
 - *Can I just use the free plan?* No, you are required to purchase the $20 per month subscription.
 - *Will I also need to buy a book?* No, there is no required textbook. We'll use a mixture of online resources for course material.


## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your other courses.

### How does it work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting about two weeks. Each sprint covers one unit of material. There will be seven sprints in our course.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll be given a list of learning topics for the sprint, a curated list of resources (videos, readings, worked examples, etc.), and a set of required deliverables due at the end of the two-week period.

3. Working with a team, you'll have broad freedom to decide how to use the available resources to learn the required material and complete the sprint deliverables. You can decide on your own meeting schedule, what resources to use, and your own plan for finishing the projects. Scrumage gives you **options** and the freedom to determine your own best learning approach.

4. As your professor, I'll be in the room each day to meet with your teams, answer your questions, and check your work-in-progress. You can make an **expert request** to ask for a short lecture, worked example, or other help with a particular topic.

5. Each sprint ends with an individual quiz.

6. You'll complete a brief reflection at the end of each sprint, which will help you understand your own learning process and make improvements before the next sprint.

### That sounds hard. Why are we doing this?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

- In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

- In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

- Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

- Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

Some of you have already taken one or more Scrumage courses with me or Dr. Summet. If this is your second or third Scrumage experience, you'll find the rhythms of this course to be similar to your previous courses. If this is your first time, don't worry: the course format may feel a little unusual at first, but you'll adapt to it quickly.

### FAQs

**How big are the teams?** I like teams of 3 as a default choice. We can do teams of 2 or 4 if necessary, but 4 is the maximum size; teams of 5 add lots of overhead for no meaningful benefit.

**How are the teams created?** I have let previous classes choose their initial teams for the first sprint. Almost all teams form at the beginning of the semester and stay together through the end.

**What if I don't want to be on a team?** Working by yourself is allowed, although you should check with me first.

**Does my grade depend on my team?** I approach the deliverables for each sprint as individual assignments that can be completed with the help of your teammates, rather than (shudder) "team projects". Most Scrumage teams operate more like collaborative study groups rather than divide-and-conquer project teams that you might have used in other classes.

**What if I can't work with my teammates? Do I have to stay in the same team?** You're allowed to change teams at the start of each sprint. One goal of Scrumage is to help you think about the kind of collaboration that works best for your learning. It's okay to recognize that some people in the class are your friends, but that you'd be better off working with a different group that's a better fit for your style.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.


### Assignments
Your grade will be based on the following things:



### Satisfactory Credit

I will grade your regular assignments and challenge projects on a threshold system. Your work will be "satisfactory" if you earn a grade of **at least 80%**.  In general, this corresponds to assignments that are

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Show real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

If you earn a grade between 60% and 79%, you'll receive **partial credit** for an assignment, discussed in more detail below. If you earn a grade below 60%, you receive **no credit** for that assignment.

You must make a reasonable attempt on every part of an assignment to receive full credit for it.

### Letter Grades

**To earn a B**, you must meet the following criteria:

1. Earn satisfactory credit on all of the regular homework assignments during the entire semester.
2. Pass the midterm and final exams with a grade of at least 80% on each.
3. Complete each portion of the research project in a satisfactory fashion.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for a B**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| Performance             | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Partial credit on an assignment (grade of 60% to 79%) | Fraction of a letter grade (e.g. B to B-)       |
| No credit on an assignment | One full letter grade (e.g., B to C) for each one |
| Exam score below 80% | Fraction of a letter grade |
| Exam score below 60% | One full letter grade |
| Unsatisfactory paper component | Fraction of a letter grade |
| Missing paper component | One full letter grade |

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional work that shows deeper engagement with the course goals. Each challenge project that you complete will **boost your grade by one part of a letter** (e.g., B to B+). To earn an A, complete all the requirements for a B plus three additional challenge projects.
         
If your grade drops, you can still complete extra work to boost it up. For example, you could get partial credit on a regular assignment, but complete a challenge project. The two would cancel each other out and your grade would remain a B.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

4. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

5. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### I Feel Decidedly Uncomfortable

This is probably a new approach to grading for you. In particular, students new to specs grading often have anxiety about the lack of partial credit in the system.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **You don't have to be perfect**. The "substantially complete and correct" standard allows for imperfections in your answers and you only need 80% of the available points, so you don't have to correctly answer everything.

2. **You *do* need to be consistent**. The system rewards you for putting forward good, consistent effort. Working diligently and carefully will allow you to accumulate all of the points that you need for a B.

3. **You will get lots of feedback**. The project specifications will tell you, unambiguously, whether your answers for a programming question are correct or not.

4. **Some work will be done in class**.

## Other Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet. **Don't attend class if you're sick**.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.

## AI Policy Statement

You are allowed to experiment with AI tools as part of your learning. I encourage you to use AI tools to engage with class material. For example, using AI for interactive tutoring can be an effective way to learn.

Some assignments, however, are only useful if they’re done by you, yourself, without AI assistance. I will provide you with instructions on how you are and are not allowed to use AI on each assignment. Using an AI tool on an assignment that prohibits it is academic misconduct and a violation of the Honor Code.

In general, it's not acceptable to use AI to generate a complete (or close to complete) solution to a problem with minimal effort or engagement on your part. Even if you *can* do this, you should assume that doing so is not meeting the goals of the assignment, and therefore not valid. Likewise, taking the output of an AI model that you generated with minimal effort and lightly editing it to present it as your own is not acceptable.

The best use of AI is as a tool for clarifying your ideas, exploring possibilities, and answering concrete questions about your work-in-progress. Keep the following facts in mind when you’re using AI tools.

- AI isn’t a shortcut. You should plan to spend about the same amount of time on an assignment with AI that you would have spent pre-AI, but produce better quality results. Mediocre AI-generated content is easy to create, but worthless. Raise your standards!

- AI models can hallucinate facts, including citations, quotes, and dates. Don’t trust the output of a model unless you know that it’s true or can check it against an independent source. AI works best on subjects you know well.

- Remember that AI has limitations and biases. Do not assume AI output is neutral. Validate against credible sources.

- Critically evaluate all results produced by an AI tool—for correctness, of course, but also for quality. Ask yourself: Is this good? Is it doing what I want? How can it be improved? You’re responsible for the quality and correctness of the finished product. AI-supported writing requires taste and judgment: practice thinking like an editor.

- Don’t simply accept the first response. You may need to ask a question multiple times, in different ways, to get a useful result. Generic prompts yield generic output. As you practice interacting with AI, you’ll learn how to use it as a collaborator.

- Learn the strengths and weaknesses of your tools and choose the right tool for the task. We’ll talk about this in class.

- AI models are software tools, not magic. Remember that you are always in control, and you’re free to accept, reject, or change AI-generated content.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.

It is acceptable to discuss questions and solutions in general terms with other class members, but your discussions should not be at a level of detail that would lead to you submitting the same work as a another student.
