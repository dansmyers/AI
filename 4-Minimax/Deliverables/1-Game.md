# Make Your Own Game

## Work with at least one other person to complete this assignment

## Overview

Create an web-based implmentation of **any two-player game** that you want to make. Your program must allow the user to play against a computer opponent that uses a minimax-based strategy.

You can pick any game you want as long as:

- It's sufficiently interesting. Simple pen-and-paper games like tic-tac-toe don't offer enough challenge to be meaningful. There are tons of options: board games are a starting place, but do some research to come up with an interesting idea

- The player goes against a computer opponent that makes decisions rationally using the minimax algorithm. A good choice will be too complex for you to simplay play out the entire game tree, so you'll need to think about designing a heuristic evaluation function to guide the program. You'll also want to implement pruning.

- It looks nice, with a crafted layout and graphics that are appropriate to the game. Don't use Claude's default choices for layout - add some of your own taste and judgment to the presentation.

Your game can have complete information or incomplete, can incorporate randomness, etc. The key idea is to **make choices** in the design of your game rather than accepting AI defaults.

Tip: What would *you* like to play? Think about what kind of games are interesting and fun *to you* and then make one.
