## Due Tuesday, April 30 (the last day of class) or thereabouts

## Final edits

Finalize the content of your paper. You’re free to use AI to suggest edits, following the model of Phase 4. Experiment with prompting the AI in different ways to provide varying perspectives on your paper—for example, by asking it to take on different roles. I recommend using Claude-3 for these tests.

Record any significant prompts you run and edits you make in your journal file.

## Reflection

Prompt the AI to act as your coach and use it to have a reflective conversation. Enter the conversation, including your responses, into your logbook. Again, I recommend using Claude-3.


*Imagine you are my coach. I just completed a research paper using AI writing tools to assist me through the process. Please have a reflective discussion with me as my coach to help me synthesize my learnings. Ask me questions like:*

- *What parts of the process went well or poorly when using the AI tools?*
- *Were there times when relying on my own analysis would have been better?*
- *How did I balance integrating AI input with maintaining my own perspective and voice?*
- *What criteria did I use to evaluate the AI's suggestions and determine what to incorporate or reject?*
- *How has this experience shaped my views on using AI tools ethically and effectively in research and writing moving forward?*
- *What advice would I give peers about getting the most out of AI tools while avoiding potential pitfalls?*

*You can prompt me with follow-up questions and prompts to push my reflection deeper. The goal is to synthesize my learnings and think critically about integrating AI thoughtfully. Please act as my coach guiding me through this reflective discussion.*


## Lessons learned

For your final element, write a one- to two-page summary talking about what you learned during this process. This is a reflection of your thoughts, so it should be written by you, without using any tools. You’re free to write whatever you think is relevant, but some things you might want to consider include:

- What were your previous experiences working with AI tools?

- How do you feel about working with AI after having completed this project? What were some things that did (or did not) surprise you?

- What advice would you give to others about working effectively with AI? What did you find useful (or not)?

- How would you approach using AI on a future project?

- Based on your experiences, how do you think education should (or should not) adapt to respond to AI?


## Submission

Submit the completed final paper, your logbook containing the reflective conversation, and the final lessons learned write-up.

You are now done.
